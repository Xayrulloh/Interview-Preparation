# TypeScript Interview Questions

## Fundamentals

1. ### **What is TypeScript?**

   _TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the
   language. It is an open-source programming language developed and maintained
   by Microsoft. TypeScript is designed for large-scale JavaScript application
   development, providing developers with tools to write more reliable and
   maintainable code_

2. ### **What are the differences between JavaScript and TypeScript?**

3. ### **What are the advantages of TypeScript over JavaScript?**
   _Below are some of the advantages of typescript over javascript_
   - TypeScript is able to find compile time errors at the development time only
   - TypeScript is strongly-typed or supports static typing
   - TypeScript compilers can compile the .ts files into ES3,ES4 and ES5

## Basic Types

4. ### **What are the primitive types in TypeScript?**

   - **Built-in types:** String
     - Number
     - Boolean
     - Null
     - Undefined
     - Any
     - Void
     - Symbol
   - **User-defined types:** Arrays
     - Enums
     - Classes
     - Interfaces

5. ### **What is the difference between never, unknown, and any?**

   - **never:**

     - Represents values that never occur
     - Used for functions that always throw or never return
     - **Example:**
       ```ts
       function throwError(
         message: string = 'What the hell is going on?'
       ): never {
         throw new Error(message)
       }
       ```

   - **unknown:**

     - Represents values we know nothing about
     - Requires type checking before use
     - **Example:**

       ```ts
       let userInput: unknown

       // Type assertion
       let userName: string = userInput as string

       // Type checking
       if (typeof userInput === 'string') {
         userName = userInput
       }
       ```

   - **any:**

     - Opts out of type checking
     - Used for dynamic content or migration
     - **Example:**

       ```ts
       let myValue: any = 42

       // No type checking is performed
       let result: string = myValue // No error at compile-time
       ```

## Variables & Functions

6. ### **What are the different keywords to declare variables in TypeScript?**

   _Like JavaScript, TypeScript has var, let, const_

7. ### **Explain the arrow function syntax in TypeScript.**

   _It's a short way to create a function_

8. ### **Provide the syntax of a function with the type annotations.**

   _Functions are blocks of code to perform a specific code. Functions can
   optionally take one or more arguments, process them, and optionally return a
   value_

   **Example:**

   ```ts
   // primitives
   let userName: string = 'Alice'
   let userAge: number = 30
   let isActive: boolean = true

   // arrays
   let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] // Array of numbers
   let names: string[] = ['John', 'Jane', 'Peter'] // Array of strings

   // objects
   let person: { name: string; age: number; city?: string } = {
     name: 'Bob',
     age: 25
   }

   // etc...
   ```

9. ### **What are anonymous functions? Provide their syntax in TypeScript**

   _An anonymous function in TypeScript is a function defined without a name.
   These functions are often used inline, as arguments to other functions
   (callbacks), or assigned to variables_

   **Example:**

   ```ts
   // function assigned to add is anonymous
   const add = function (a: number, b: number): number {
     return a + b
   }

   console.log(add(5, 3)) // Output: 8
   ```

10. ### **What are the rest parameters and arguments in TypeScript?**

    _Rest parameters allows a function to take all arguments as one array_

    **Example:**

    ```ts
    function restF(...args: number[]) {
      return args.join('')
    }
    ```

11. ### **What is parameter destructuring?**

    _It's a way to unpack the object provided as an argument to function_

    **Example:**

    ```ts
    const { name, age } = { name: 'deeng', age: 1 } // in objects
    const [first, second, ...others] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] // in array
    ```

12. ### **Provide the TypeScript syntax to create function overloads.**

    _It allows us to create multiple functions with the same name but different
    arguments. Typescript itself defines by argument_

    **Example:**

    ```ts
    // Overload signatures
    function combine(a: number, b: number): number
    function combine(a: string, b: string): string

    // Implementation signature (must be compatible with all overloads)
    function combine(a: any, b: any): any {
      if (typeof a === 'number' && typeof b === 'number') {
        return a + b // Performs addition for numbers
      } else if (typeof a === 'string' && typeof b === 'string') {
        return a + b // Performs concatenation for strings
      }
      throw new Error(
        "Invalid arguments: 'combine' expects either two numbers or two strings."
      )
    }

    // Usage examples
    console.log(combine(5, 10)) // Output: 15 (number)
    console.log(combine('Hello, ', 'World!')) // Output: "Hello, World!" (string)

    // This would result in a TypeScript error:
    // combine(5, "World!"); // Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
    ```

## Objects & Interfaces

13. ### **How to create objects in TypeScript?**

    _Objects are collections of keys and values. And the keys must be unique.
    It's the same as Js to create obj in Ts_

14. ### **How to specify optional properties in TypeScript?**

    _By using ? after the property name we can specify it as optional_

15. ### **What is an interface in TypeScript, and how is it different from a class?**

    _In TypeScript, an interface serves as a blueprint for defining how an
    object should look. It outlines the properties an object should have and
    their respective types but doesn't include any actual code_

    **Example:**

    ```ts
    interface Person {
      name: string
      age: number
    }

    const me: Person = {
      name: 'Me',
      age: 1
    }

    // the Person interface helps us define what properties a me object should have â€“ in this case, a name of type string and an age of type number
    ```

16. ### **What is the difference between type and interface?**

    _Both type and interface are used to define custom types, but there are
    subtle differences in their capabilities and use cases_

    - **Declaration Syntax:**

      - **Interface:** _Interfaces are typically used to define object shapes.
        They can describe the structure of objects, including properties,
        methods, and index signatures_

      ```ts
      interface Person {
        name: string
        age: number
      }
      ```

      - **Type:** _The type keyword is more versatile. It can be used to define
        object types, union types, intersection types, and more_

      ```ts
      type Person = {
        name: string
        age: number
      }
      ```

    - **Extending and Implementing:**

      - **Interface:** _Interfaces can extend other interfaces using the extends
        keyword. They are also used for class implementation_

      ```ts
      interface Animal {
        legs: number
      }

      interface Dog {
        breed: string
      }
      ```

      - **Type:** _The type keyword can be used for creating union types,
        intersection types, and mapped types. However, it cannot be extended or
        implemented like interfaces_

      ```ts
      type Animal = {
        legs: number
      }
      type Dog = Animal & {
        breed: string
      }
      ```

    - **Declaration Merging:**

      - **Interface:** _Interfaces support declaration merging, which allows
        multiple interface declarations with the same name to be merged into a
        single declaration_

      ```ts
      interface Car {
        model: string
      }
      interface Car {
        brand: string
      }
      // Merged interface
      // {model: string, brand: string}
      ```

      - **Type:** _The type keyword does not support declaration merging. If you
        try to declare two types with the same name, it will result in an error_

      ```ts
      type Car = {
        model: string
      }

      // Error: Duplicate identifier
      type Car = {
        brand: string
      }
      ```

    - **Immutability:**

      - **Interface:** _Interfaces are open to extension, meaning you can add
        new properties when extending an interface_

      ```ts
      interface Person {
        name: string
        age: number
      }

      // Extending the interface
      interface PersonWithAddress extends Person {
        address: string
      }
      ```

      - **Type:** _The type keyword supports mapped types, allowing the creation
        of new types based on existing ones. However, it is generally considered
        more closed to modification_

      ```ts
      type Person = {
        name: string
        age: number
      }

      // Creating a new type based on an existing type
      type PersonWithAddress = Person & {
        address: string
      }
      ```

    - **Choosing Between type and interface:**
      - **Interface:**
        - _Defining object shapes, especially for objects that represent
          instances of a class_
        - _Extending other interfaces or implementing classes_
      - **Type:**
        - _Defining union types, intersection types, or creating complex types
          that involve mapped types_
        - _Expressing types that cannot be represented using interfaces_
      - _In practice, the choice between type and interface often comes down to
        personal or team preferences. Some developers prefer the clarity and
        convention of using interfaces for object shapes, while others
        appreciate the flexibility and versatility provided by the type keyword.
        Both type and interface are powerful tools in TypeScript, and you can
        choose the one that best fits your use case_

17. ### **Declaration merging?**

- Declaration merging is a feature in TypeScript that allows you to combine
  multiple declarations of the same name into a single definition. This is
  particularly useful with interface (but not with type)\*

## Classes & OOP

18. ### **Explain the TypeScript class syntax.**

    _It's same as JavaScript_

19. ### **What are abstract classes? When should you use one?**

    _Abstract classes are similar to interfaces in that they specify a contract
    for the objects, and you cannot instantiate them directly_

20. ### **How to make object properties immutable in TypeScript?**

    _By using **readonly** keyword before the property name_

21. ### **What are the **'implements'** clauses in TypeScript?**

    _It's used to check that a class satisfies the contract specified by an
    interface_

22. ### **Explain the concept of inheritance in TypeScript.**
    _It allows us to extend from another class and reuse or modify the behavior_

## Advanced Types

23. ### **What are Union and Intersection Types?**  
    * **Union Type:** *In TypeScript, union types, marked by **|**, allow a variable to have values from different types*
    ```ts
    type Cat = { name: string, meow: () => void };
    type Dog = { name: string, bark: () => void };

    const pet: Cat | Dog = // Either Cat or Dog
    ```

    * **Intersection Type:** *Intersection types, shown by **&**, bring together multiple types to form a new type with all the properties of each individual type*
    ```ts
    type Name = string
    type Age = number

    type Person = Name & Age

    const me: Person = {name: 'me', age: 1}
    ```

24. ### **What are type aliases? How do you create one?**  
    *If we've variable either string or number. We can create type something
    **string | number** and use this type to that variable*

25. ### **What are string literal types?**  
    *You can refer to specific string or numbers as types*
    ```ts
    let status: "active";
    status = "active"; // Valid
    status = "inactive"; // Error: Type '"inactive"' is not assignable to type '"active"'.
    ```

26. ### **What are template literal types?**  
    *They're like string literal but you can combine them with concrete*
    ```ts
    type Size = "small" | "medium" | "large";
    type SizeMessage = `The selected size is ${Size}.`;

    let message1: SizeMessage = "The selected size is small."; // Valid
    let message2: SizeMessage = "The selected size is extra-large."; // Error: Type '"The selected size is extra-large."' is not assignable to type '"The selected size is small." | "The selected size is medium." | "The selected size is large."'.
    ```

27. ### **What are Conditional Types?**  
    *Conditional types in TypeScript help us describe different type mappings
    based on certain conditions*
    ```ts
    type IsString<T> = T extends string ? true : false;

    type A = IsString<"hello">; // type A = true
    type B = IsString<123>;     // type B = false
    ```

28. ### **What are mapped types, and how do they work?**  
    *Mapped types in TypeScript allow you to create new types by changing the
    properties of existing ones*
    ```ts
    type OriginalType = {
        propA: string;
        propB: number;
    };

    // Example of a mapped type making all properties optional
    type OptionalType<T> = {
        [K in keyof T]?: T[K];
    };

    type MyOptionalType = OptionalType<OriginalType>;
    // MyOptionalType will be: { propA?: string; propB?: number; }
    ```

29. ### **List some of the utility types provided by TypeScript and explain their usage**  
    *Partial, Required, Readonly, Record, Promise, Awaited etc...*

## Special Types

30. ### **What is void, and when to use the void type?**  
    *Let's say you've a function which returns nothing, that means it's void
    function*

31. ### **Explain the concept of null and its use in TypeScript**  
    *Null value indicates an absence of value, hence you cannot access any
    properties on the variable or call a method on it. It's more like it's
    nothing*

32. ### **What is undefined in TypeScript?**  
    *When a variable is declared without initialization it becomes undefined*

## Arrays & Tuples

33. ### **Explain how the arrays work in TypeScript**  
    *We use arrays to store values of the same type. Arrays are ordered and
    indexed collections of values*

34. ### **Explain how tuple destructuring works in TypeScript**  
    *Instead of giving one type to array elements we can separate them one by
    one, this is why we need tuples. And it's works pretty easy like
    destructuring*
    ```ts
    // Define a tuple type
    type UserInfo = [number, string, boolean];

    // Create a tuple instance
    const user: UserInfo = [101, "Alice", true];

    // Destructure the tuple into individual variables
    const [id, name, isActive] = user;

    console.log(id);       // Output: 101
    console.log(name);     // Output: Alice
    console.log(isActive); // Output: true
    ```

## Enums

35. ### **What is enums?**  
    *In TypeScript, enums work similarly to enums in other programming languages,
    providing a way to define a set of named constants*
    ```ts
    // Numeric Enum
    enum DaysOfWeek {
        Sunday,
        Monday,
        Tuesday,
        Wednesday,
        Thursday,
        Friday,
        Saturday
    }

    let today: DaysOfWeek = DaysOfWeek.Monday // 1
    // ------
    // String Enum
    enum DaysOfWeek {
        Sunday = 'Sunday',
        Monday = 'Monday',
        Tuesday = 'Tuesday',
        Wednesday = 'Wednesday',
        Thursday = 'Thursday',
        Friday = 'Friday',
        Saturday = 'Saturday'
    }
    let today: DaysOfWeek = DaysOfWeek.Monday // Monday
    ```

## Modern Features

36. ### **What is optional chaining?**  
    *Instead of checking all the way down we can just use a ?. And it returns
    undefined it's not exist*
    ```ts
    interface User {
        name: string;
        address?: {
            street: string;
            city?: string; // city is optional
        };
    }

    const user1: User = { name: "Alice", address: { street: "Main St" } };
    const user2: User = { name: "Bob" }; // No address property

    // Accessing a potentially nested property safely
    const city1 = user1.address?.city; // "undefined" (because city is optional and not provided)
    const city2 = user2.address?.city; // "undefined" (because address is missing)

    // Calling a method safely
    interface Service {
        doSomething?(): void;
    }

    const service1: Service = { doSomething: () => console.log("Doing something") };
    const service2: Service = {};

    service1.doSomething?.(); // Calls the method
    service2.doSomething?.(); // Does nothing, no error
    ```

37. ### **What is the 'in' operator?**  
    *It's used to find if a property is in the specified object*
    ```ts
    const car = { make: 'Toyota', model: 'Corolla' };
    console.log('make' in car); // true
    console.log('year' in car); // false
    ```

38. ### **What are TypeScript decorators, and how do they work?**  
    *TypeScript decorators are special functions used to modify or add behavior
    to classes, methods, properties, or parameters at runtime*
    ```ts
    function first() {
        console.log("first(): factory evaluated");
        return function (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
            console.log("first(): called");
        };
    }
    
    function second() {
        console.log("second(): factory evaluated");
        return function (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
            console.log("second(): called");
        };
    }
    
    class ExampleClass {
        @first()
        @second()
        method() {}
    }

    // output:
    // first(): factory evaluated
    // second(): factory evaluated
    // second(): called
    // first(): called
    ```

## Configuration

39. ### **What is the purpose of the tsconfig.json file?**  
    *It provides the compiler options to compile the project*

40. ### **How to enforce strict null checks in TypeScript?**  
    *It's a way to check all possibilities that can be null. And to enforce it we
    change tsconfig.json file strictNullChecks to true*

## Type System

41. ### **What is meant by type inference?**  
    *When you don't provide an explicit type typescript itself defines type*
    ```ts
    let x = 10; // TypeScript infers 'x' as 'number'
    let message = "Hello"; // TypeScript infers 'message' as 'string'
    ```

42. ### **What is meant by contextual typing?**  
    *When the typescript compiler uses the location of a variable to infer its
    type, it's called contextual typing*
    ```ts
    window.onmousedown = function(mouseEvent) {
        console.log(mouseEvent.button); // No error, TypeScript infers mouseEvent as MouseEvent
        console.log(mouseEvent.kangaroo); // Error: Property 'kangaroo' does not exist on type 'MouseEvent'
    };
    ```

43. ### **What is the typeof operator? How is it used in TypeScript?**  
    *Like JavaScript, **typeof** identifies type of value and it's used for it*

44. ### **When would you use type assertion?**  
    *Type assertion in TypeScript is a mechanism to tell the compiler that you
    know more about the type of a value than TypeScript can infer*
    ```ts
    // as keyword
    let someValue: any = "this is a string";
    let strLength: number = (someValue as string).length;

    // <> syntax
    let someValue: any = "this is a string";
    let strLength: number = (<string>someValue).length;
    ```

## Advanced Concepts

45. ### **Does TypeScript support static classes? If not, why?**  
    *In Typescript you can create any data and functions as simple objects
    without creating a containing class. Hence typescript doesn't need static
    classes*

46. ### **What is the Function type in TypeScript?**  
    *Function is a global type in typescript and it has properties like bind,
    call and apply with other properties*

47. ### **What is a type declaration file?**  
    *It's a file which ends with .d.ts extension providing a way to declare the
    existence of some types or values without actually providing implementations
    for those values*

48. ### **Explain the various ways to control member visibility in TypeScript.**  
    * **public:** *You can access a public member anywhere outside the class*  
    * **protected:** *It's visible only to the subclasses*  
    * **private:** *It's only visible inside the class*

49. ### **What are Type Guards?**  
    * **typeof:** *check primitive types*  
    * **keyof:** *check is key available in object*  
    * **instanceof:** *check class instances*  
    * **in:** *check if a property exist in an object*  
    * **is:** *User Defined Type Guard*

50. ### **Explain how TypeScript infers types?**  
    *TypeScript uses type inference to automatically determine the types of
    variables based on their assigned values while declaring*

51. ### **What are generics in TypeScript, and when would you use them?**  
    *Generics in TypeScript provide a way to create reusable components and
    functions while maintaining flexibility in the types they work with*
    ```ts
    // functions
    function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
      return arg;
    }
    let output = identity<string>("hello"); // T is inferred as string

    // interfaces
    interface Box<T> {
      value: T;
    }
    let stringBox: Box<string> = { value: "text" };

    // classes
    class GenericContainer<T> {
      private data: T;
      constructor(data: T) {
        this.data = data;
      }
      getData(): T {
        return this.data;
      }
    }
    let numberContainer = new GenericContainer<number>(123);

    // constraints
    interface Lengthwise {
      length: number;
    }
    function loggingIdentity<T extends Lengthwise>(arg: T): T {
      console.log(arg.length); // Now 'arg' is guaranteed to have a 'length' property
      return arg;
    }
    ```

52. ### **What is the declare keyword?**  
    *The declare keyword in TypeScript is used to inform the compiler that a
    variable, method, or library is defined externally*
    ```ts
    declare const jQuery: (selector: string) => any;
    declare function myFunction(arg: number): string;
    declare class MyGlobalClass {
        constructor(name: string);
        method(): void;
    }
    ```

## Enums vs Types

53. ### **Enums vs type declaration (type and interface)**  
    *Enum exists in JS but type declaration erased and used only for TS checks*

## Loops

54. ### **Explain the different variants of the for loop in TypeScript.**  
    *for, for in, for of, forEach*

## Symbols

55. ### **Explain the symbol type in TypeScript.**  
    *The way to create unique primitive type value*
