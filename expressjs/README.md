# Express.js Interview Questions

1. ## [**What is Express.Js**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-express/)

   Express is a lightweight framework built on top of Node.js to enhance its web
   server capabilities. It simplifies APIs, introduces useful features, and
   facilitates application organization through middleware and routing. Express
   also enriches Node.js HTTP objects with valuable utilities and supports
   dynamic rendering.

2. ## **Why use Express.Js**

   It is a lightweight and flexible framework, which makes it a preferred choice
   for web applications. It is easy to set up and use middlewares and routing.

3. ## **Explain the features of Express.js**

   Express.js is a powerful and popular Node.js web framework, which offers a
   wide range of features to ease the development of web applications. Some of
   the key features of Express.js include: routing, middleware, HTTP utility
   methods, static file serving, and built-in security features, such as
   protection against cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery
   (CSRF). Additionally, Express.js is highly extensible through its support for
   a wide range of third-party packages and plugins.

4. ## [**Explain the structure of an Express JS application**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-structure-my-application-in-express-js/)
   - **Entry point:** It’s a starting point of the application where you set up
     your server, connect to your database, add middleware, and define the main
     routes
   - **Routes directory:** It contains files for the app’s routes
   - **Controllers directory:** It contains files that define the logic to
     handle requests for a specific route
   - **Models directory:** It used for creating the schema models for the
     different data
   - **Middleware directory:** It contains custom middleware functions that you
     can use in your routes
   - **Views directory:** It contains your view templates
   - **Public directory:** It contains static files that are served directly by
     the server such as images, css files, and javascript files

5. ## [**Why should you separate the Express app and server**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/why-express-app-and-server-files-kept-separately/)

   The server is responsible for initializing the routes, middleware, and other
   application logic whereas the app has all the business logic that will be
   served by the routes initiated by the server. This provides the modularity
   and flexibility and makes the codebase more easier to maintain and test.

6. ## **Define the concept of the test pyramid**

   The Test Pyramid consist of three levels:
   - Unit Tests
   - Integration Tests
   - and End-toEnd (E2E) Tests

7. ## [**Explain what CORS is in Express JS**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-allow-cors-in-express/)

   CORS refers to a middleware that enables Cross Origin Resource Sharing for
   your application. This allows the application to control which domains can
   access your resources by setting HTTP headers

8. ## **What is middleware**

   Middleware comes in between your request and business logic. It is mainly
   used for logs, rate limit, routing, authentication etc.. There are also
   third-party middleware such as body-parser etc...

9. ## **What are the types of middleware**

   There are five types of Middleware in Express.js
   - Application level
   - Router level
   - Error handling
   - Built-in
   - Third party

10. ## [**How can you deal with error handling in Express.js**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explain-error-handling-in-express-js-using-an-example/)

    When an error occurs, you can pass it to the next middleware or route
    handler using the next() function. You can also add an error handling
    middleware to your application that will be executed whenever an error
    occurs

11. **Explain Express.js life cycle**  
    1\. Request Received  
    2\. Routing  
    3\. Middleware  
    4\. Route Handler Execution  
    5\. Response Sent  
    6\. Error Handling  
    7\. Request End

    The request lifecycle in Express.js is a structured flow from the request
    being received, through routing and middleware, to finally sending a
    response. Middleware plays a crucial role in controlling this flow, and
    error handling ensures that unexpected issues are managed gracefully
