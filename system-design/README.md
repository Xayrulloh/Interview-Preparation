# System Design Interview Preparation

- ## ðŸ§  Core Concepts in System Design

  _This step covers foundational system design concepts that are essential for
  technical interviews, designing scalable systems, and making architectural
  decisions_

  - ### Scalability

    **What is it?** _Scalability is the system's ability to handle increased
    load without degrading performance._

    **Types:**

    - **Vertical Scaling (Scale-Up):** _Add more resources (CPU, RAM) to a
      single machine._
    - **Horizontal Scaling (Scale-Out):** _Add more machines to distribute the
      load._

    **When to Use:**

    - _When your user base or data volume is growing._
    - _When performance bottlenecks arise due to limited hardware._

    **Trade-offs:**

    - _Vertical scaling is simple but has limits._
    - _Horizontal scaling requires distributed coordination (e.g., sharding,
      replication)._

    **Examples:**

    - _Adding more web servers behind a load balancer._
    - _Splitting a monolithic database by user ID._

  - ### Latency vs Throughput

    **What is it?**

    - **Latency:** _Time it takes to process a single request._
    - **Throughput:** _Number of requests processed per unit time._

    **When to Focus On:**

    - **Latency:** _Real-time applications like chat, video calls._
    - **Throughput:** _Background processing, analytics systems._

    **Trade-off:** _Batching requests increases throughput but adds latency._

    **Examples:**

    - **Kafka:** _Streams can process millions of events per second (high
      throughput)._
    - **REST APIs** _Should respond within 200ms for good user experience (low
      latency)._

  - ### CAP Theorem (Availability vs Consistency)

    **What is it?** _In distributed systems, you can only have two out of
    three:_

    - **Consistency:** _All nodes see the same data._
    - **Availability:** _Every request gets a response (even during failures)._
    - **Partition Tolerance:** _System continues working even with network
      splits._

    **When to Use:**

    - **Consistency:** _Banking, inventory systems._
    - **Availability:** _Social networks, logging systems._

    **Examples:**

    - **CP:** _HBase, MongoDB (strong consistency mode)._
    - **AP:** _DynamoDB, CouchDB._

  - ### Load Balancing

    - **Eventual Consistency:** _Data becomes consistent over time._
    - **Causal Consistency, Read-Your-Writes, Monotonic Reads:** _Middle-ground
      models._
